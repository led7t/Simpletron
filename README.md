# Simpletron
//Laura E Dean
//Spring 2018
//Version 3.0


//Simpletron is a simple machine that takes user input to complete an operation.
//The Simpletron runs programs written in the only language it directly understands: Simpletron Machine Language, or SML for short.
//All the information in the Simpletron is handled in terms of words. A word is a signed four-digit decimal number.
//Simpletron is equipped with a 100-word memory, and these words are referenced by their location numbers.
//The first two digits of each SML instruction are the operation code specifying the operation to be performed.
//The last two digits of an SML instruction are the operandâ€”the address of the memory location containing the word to which the operation applies.



//Updates from version 1 to version 2:
//Ability to read in a program from a text file rather than input it via the program
//Memory dump after the completion of a program


//Upates from version 2 to version 3:
//New operations REMAINDER, EXPONENTIATION, and NEWLINE added.
